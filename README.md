# Advent of code 2022 Kotlin

> 📝 Note

> Kotlin is not my primary programming language, so don't use this code in production. 😉

In this repository, I post solutions for the [Advent of Code][aoc] puzzles using [Kotlin][kotlin] language.

[Advent of Code][aoc] – An annual event of Christmas-oriented programming challenges started December 2015.
    Every year since then, beginning on the first day of December, a programming puzzle is published every day for twenty-five days.
    Everyone can solve the puzzle and provide an answer using the language of your choice.
